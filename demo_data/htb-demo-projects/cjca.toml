### Phase 1: Grey Box Penetration Test
Testing will be performed under a "grey box" approach, where {{ report.assessor_full }} has limited prior knowledge of {{ report.customer_short }}’s environment (e.g., basic network diagrams or IP ranges) but no credentials or detailed internal configurations. The objective is to identify unknown weaknesses from an attacker's perspective with partial visibility. Testing will be conducted remotely via a provisioned host, adopting a non-evasive standpoint initially to uncover misconfigurations and vulnerabilities through reconnaissance, scanning, and targeted exploitation. Each identified weakness will be documented and manually investigated for exploitation possibilities, including potential foothold establishment, lateral movement, and horizontal/vertical privilege escalation. If a foothold is gained, {{ report.customer_short }} authorizes further internal testing to demonstrate the full impact of a compromise, such as data exfiltration or domain control, while adhering to rules of engagement to avoid production impacts.

### Phase 2: SIEM Alert Validation and Analysis
Following the penetration test, {{ report.customer_short }}’s security team will reproduce the identified attack paths in a controlled staging environment. These simulations will generate telemetry data, which will be ingested into their Elastic SIEM platform. Based on this data, the SIEM will generate security alerts tied to the techniques used during the simulated attacks. {{ report.assessor_full }} will review these alerts to determine whether each one represents a true positive or a false positive, providing supporting evidence from the SIEM logs for each decision.

Throughout both phases, {{ report.assessor_full }} will prioritize safety, with predefined escalation protocols for any high-risk findings, and collaborate with {{ report.customer_short }}'s IT/security team for validation and controlled testing.
