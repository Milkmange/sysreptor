TODO Royal Flush Ltd. ("RoyalFlush" herein), Secure Data Ltd. ("SecureData" herein), and Vita Medix Ltd. ("VitaMedix" herein) have invited 
TODO YOUR_NAME
to perform a targeted Web Application Penetration Test of their web applications to identify high-risk security weaknesses, assess their impact, document all findings in a clear, professional, and repeatable manner, and provide remediation recommendations.

All web-related findings were considered in-scope, as long as they can be proven harmful to the client with a Medium-High impact. The following types of activities were considered out-of-scope for this test:

* Physical attacks against the clients' properties
* Unverified scanner output
* Any vulnerabilities identified through DDoS or spam attacks
* Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries unless they can be leveraged to impact the target significantly
* Any theoretical attacks or attacks that require significant user interaction or are considered low-risk

TODO YOUR_NAME performed testing under a mixture of "blackbox" and a "whitebox" approach from TODO START_DATE to TODO END_DATE, as follows:

TODO: update approach
* `RoyalFlush` A whitebox penetration test was carried against their targets, with access to their web applications' source code on `http://git.royalflush.htb/`.
* `SecureData` A blackbox penetration test was performed, with no further details or access to their web applications.
* `VitaMedix` A mixture of blackbox and whitebox was carried against all web applications under their sub-domains.

Testing was performed remotely from a non-evasive standpoint, with the goal of uncovering as many misconfigurations and vulnerabilities as possible. Each weakness identified was documented and manually investigated to determine exploitation possibilities and escalation potential.

TODO YOUR_NAME sought to demonstrate the full impact of every vulnerability, up to and including internal network access. Furthermore, TODO YOUR_NAME has also documented the sources of vulnerabilities that were identified through source code analysis, and provided recommended patches to fix them.
