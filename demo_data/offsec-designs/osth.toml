    # OffSec Threat Hunter Exam Report {.in-toc.numbered}
    ## Introduction {.in-toc.numbered}
    The OffSec Threat Hunter exam report contains all efforts that were conducted in order to pass the OffSec certification examination. This report should contain all items that were used to pass the exam and it will be graded from a standpoint of correctness and fullness to all aspects of the exam. The purpose of this report is to ensure that the student has a full understanding of threat hunting methodologies as well as the technical knowledge to pass the qualifications for the OffSec Threat Hunter.

    ## Objective {.in-toc.numbered}
    The objective of this assessment is to perform a threat hunting sprint in the Megacorp One environment. The student is tasked with following a methodical approach to identify all compromised systems and detect if sensitive data was exfiltrated or encrypted. 

    An example page has already been created for you at the latter portions of this document that should demonstrate the amount of information and detail that is expected in the exam report. Use the sample report as a guideline to get you through the reporting.

    ## Requirements {.in-toc.numbered}
    The student will be required to fill out this threat hunting report fully and to include the following sections:
    
    * Executive Summary
    * Methodology
    * Hunt Narrative
        * A detailed walkthrough of the entire threat hunting sprint.
        * The walkthrough should contain an explanation of all steps, assumptions, and decisions supported by screenshots and Splunk queries if applicable.
        * The walkthrough should be thorough enough that the complete threat hunting sprint can be replicated step-by-step by a technically competent reader.
    * Findings
        * A timeline of all key activities related to the attacker's actions
    * Conclusion
    * IoC Lists in the Appendix

The threat hunting sprint began with the assignment of reviewing the threat intelligence report of an APT group known as "We Are Garfield" (WAG) and proactively hunting for indicators of a compromise within the Megacorp One systems. The primary objectives were to identify all compromised systems and assess the impact of the attacker’s actions, such as determining whether data has been exfiltrated or encrypted.

During the threat hunt, we identified three compromised systems within the Megacorp One environment:

TODO: adapt methodology

For the scheduled threat hunting sprint, we utilized the following tools, scripts, commands, and resources:

* Splunk
* WAG Threat Intelligence Report
* PowerShell on DEV (Deobfuscation)

We performed an intelligence-based threat hunting sprint based on the information provided in the WAG threat intelligence report. This approach led us to detect the usage of Mimikatz on PC2, which revealed several additional indicators for further investigation. By analyzing these indicators, we were able to identify lateral movement to PC3 by correlating login and Sysmon events in Splunk with the known tools and techniques categorized under the "Lateral Movement" column. Through this analysis, we also discovered that after compromising PC3, the attacker exfiltrated a sensitive document.

After exhausting our list of IoCs and other information from the intelligence-based phase, we transitioned to hypothesis-based threat hunting. This shift provided us with the flexibility to investigate how PC2 was accessed and how the perimeter was breached, considering that this is not a publicly accessible machine.

Our hunting hypothesis was:

We suspect that PC3 and PC2 are not the only systems compromised by the WAG threat actor. While we couldn't identify any further indicators that revealed additional compromised systems using the credentials obtained from PC2, or following the compromise of PC3, it is likely that PC2 was not the initial system compromised by WAG, given that it is not externally accessible. Therefore, we suspect that at least one other machine is compromised. We will validate this by investigating the events preceding the use of Mimikatz to obtain credentials and by identifying the vector the threat actor used to access PC2 and breach the perimeter.

By analyzing these indicators, we were able to identify lateral movement to PC3 by correlating login and Sysmon events in Splunk with the known tools and techniques categorized under the "Lateral Movement" column. Through this analysis, we also discovered that after compromising PC3, the attacker exfiltrated a sensitive document.

After exhausting our list of IoCs and other information from the intelligence-based phase, we transitioned to hypothesis-based threat hunting. This shift provided us with the flexibility to investigate how PC2 was accessed and how the perimeter was breached, considering that this is not a publicly accessible machine.

Our hunting hypothesis was:

We suspect that PC3 and PC2 are not the only systems compromised by the WAG threat actor. While we couldn't identify any further indicators that revealed additional compromised systems using the credentials obtained from PC2, or following the compromise of PC3, it is likely that PC2 was not the initial system compromised by WAG, given that it is not externally accessible. Therefore, we suspect that at least one other machine is compromised. We will validate this by investigating the events preceding the use of Mimikatz to obtain credentials and by identifying the vector the threat actor used to access PC2 and breach the perimeter.

TODO: Hunt Narrative
* A detailed walkthrough of the entire threat hunting sprint.
* The walkthrough should contain an explanation of all steps, assumptions, and decisions supported by screenshots and Splunk queries if applicable.
* The walkthrough should be thorough enough that the complete threat hunting sprint can be replicated step-by-step by a technically competent reader.

TODO: Conclusion

Our threat hunting sprint successfully uncovered three compromised systems within the Megacorp One enterprise, along with the exfiltration of our secret chocolate muffin recipe.

Based on our findings and actionable insights, the incident response team can now initiate the necessary steps for incident detection and identification, containment, and restoration of the compromised systems. In addition, any policy- or regulation-driven actions can be initiated to ensure compliance and further secure the organization.

For comprehensive guidance on potential remediation steps and enhancing detection capabilities, please refer to the compiled list of IoCs provided in the Appendix of this report. These IoCs serve as a valuable reference and baseline for improving our organization's overall security resilience against similar threats in the future.
