# About this project
We're glad you're here to contribute and to make pentest reporting even easier.  
Thank you for investing your time.

We strive for openness and broad availability to pentesting companies. This is why this project is source-available (but not Open Source) and SysReptor Community is free to use for everyone.

Maintaining such a project is time-consuming and expensive. This is why SysReptor is a commercial product, financed by our SysReptor Professional customers. Thank you for this ❤️

# How to contribute to the SysReptor software
## Plugins
### SysReptor
SysReptor has a [plugin system](https://docs.sysreptor.com/setup/plugins/#developing-custom-plugins) that allows you to extend functionality and customize your reporting workflow.  
See [example issues](https://github.com/Syslifters/sysreptor/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22help%20wanted%22%20label%3Aplugin).

### reptor
SysReptor has an Open Source [Python library](https://docs.sysreptor.com/python-library/) and [command line tool](https://docs.sysreptor.com/cli/getting-started/) [reptor](https://github.com/syslifters/reptor/).  
This allows you integrating your toolset and your activities with SysReptor.

Feel free to [discuss plugin ideas](https://github.com/Syslifters/sysreptor/discussions/categories/q-a) before starting development, to [ask questions](https://github.com/Syslifters/sysreptor/discussions/categories/q-a), or to [demonstrate and share](https://github.com/Syslifters/sysreptor/discussions/categories/show-and-tell) your implemented functionaliites.

## Core
If you want to enhance functionalities in SysReptor core, we are happy to receive your pull requests. We recommend starting with small features and to [discuss feature ideas](https://github.com/Syslifters/sysreptor/discussions/categories/q-a) before starting. This allows us to anticipate any obstacles that may arise.  
See [easy first issues](https://github.com/Syslifters/sysreptor/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22easy%20first%20issue%22).  
See [issues where we might need your help](https://github.com/Syslifters/sysreptor/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22help%20wanted%22).

### Contributor Agreement  
To make sure we can use your changes without restriction, we are asking SysReptor core contributors to sign our Contributor Agreement.  
Contributor Agreements are generally common and accepted in many Open Source software projects.

We tried to make the process of signing as easy as possible.  
You can sign our Contributor Agreement at https://cla-assistant.io/Syslifters/sysreptor using your GitHub account. Use the account's email address for your commits to successfully pass all checks for our pull requests.

(SysReptor plugins and reptor plugins don't require signing the agreement, as they are Open Source under permissive licenses.)

## Dependencies
You can use external dependencies if they have permissive licenses (like MIT, BSD, etc.) or are licensed under LGPL. You can always use software under licenses on [Blue Oak Council’s permissive license list](https://blueoakcouncil.org/list) with a rating of "Bronze" or better.
